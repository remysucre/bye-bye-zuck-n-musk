# Bye bye Zuck 'n Musk

To celebrate the beginning of the downfall of facebook and twitter and to accelerate their implosion, 
I have compiled a list of alternative platforms that are less evil. PRs are welcome. 

## Principles
- The platform must not sell user data. 
- The platform should be mature with a healthy community of active users. 
- The platform can be commercial, but with a healthy bussiness model that does not abuse its users.
